# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Page Description

This is a daily scheduling application/planner. 

At the top of the page, the current date is displayed. Below that, are (what are supposed to be) standard daily working hours (of course, they aren't anymore. The days of Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 are long gone). These rows are updated to reflect current time, so that when the hour has passed, the associated row turns grey. Rows with hours in the future are green, and the current hour is highlighted as red. Each row allows you to enter text; you can type reminders here, events you have scheduled, etc. All the way to the right on each row is a save button. When you hit the save button on the corresponding row, it saves the text you've entered to local data.

## Credits

This application is primarily composed of code provided by the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp Program. This includes all of the CSS, and a great deal of the HTML. The rest of the HTML and all of the JavaScript was written by me, although I owe a debt of gratitude to a tutor from the Univeristy of Minnesota, and one of the TAs for the class for providing guidance.
